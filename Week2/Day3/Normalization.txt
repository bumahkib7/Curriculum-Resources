Normalization 

Normalization is the process of reducing data redundancy in our database.
There are 6 levels of Normalization, Normal Forms. Industry standard
for Normalization is 3rd Normal Form (anything above that is more 
academic) 

What is data redundancy?
	Keeping track of unnecessary data in our tables because 
	our table is not structured appropriately.

"The key, the whole key, and nothing but the key"

"The Key"
First level of normalization is: 
1 NF: 
	Primary Key: Unique indentifier for row/records
	Atomic Columns: Smallest indivisable amount of data 

"The Whole Key"
2 NF: 
	We need to have achieved 1 NF. 
	We have no PARTIAL dependencies on the primary key
	(DO NOT SAY 'remove any composite key')

"Nothing but the key"
3 NF: 
	We need to achieve 2 NF. 
	We have no TRANSITIVE dependencies. 
	(All columns are directly dependent on the primary key and
	not indirectly)

(Transitive property: 
	If I have numbers, a, b and c. 
	If a > b and b > c 
	That means a > c 

	If I have 3 people, bob, steve and rory.
	If Rory and Steve race, and Rory wins. 
	If Steve and Bob race, and Steve wins. 

	That means that Rory is also faster than Bob, without having to
	race him. 

Key terminology: 
	Primary Key 
	Foreign Key 
	Candidate Key: is a column that can "act" as a primary key (but is not)
	Composite Key: is multiple columns that acts as a primary key.
